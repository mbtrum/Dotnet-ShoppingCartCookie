Create a web app

Create a model called Product

Add 2 fields to Product, ProductId and ProductName

Scaffold to model (this will do all the imports for entity framework)

Create the database table (migration)

Add some products to the database.

On the Details page, add a form and a button to "Add to Cart". 
Then when the user clicks it, handle the OnPost() and add the Product to cart (the cookie).
Basically re-purpose the Details page to be a 'checkout' page.

Now add it to your cookie.
