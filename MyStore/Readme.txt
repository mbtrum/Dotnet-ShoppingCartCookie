ï»¿Simulate a shopping cart
-------------------------------

Create a web app

Create a model called Product

Add 2 fields to Product, ProductId and ProductName

Scaffold the model (this will do all the imports for entity framework)

Create the database table (migration)

Add some products to the database.

On the Details page, add a form and a button to "Add to Cart". 
Then when the user clicks it, handle the OnPost() and add the Product Id to cart (the cookie).
Basically re-purpose the Details page to be a 'checkout' page.

You can view the cookie value in your browser's Developer Tools. Take a screen shot
of the cookie with some Product Ids in it, and upload to Brightspace.
